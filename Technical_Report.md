## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modern full-stack architecture, separating concerns between the backend (API, AI, data) and frontend (UI, user experience):

```
+-------------------+        REST API       +-------------------+
|    Frontend       | <-------------------> |     Backend       |
|  (Next.js/React)  |                       |  (FastAPI/Python) |
+-------------------+                       +-------------------+
         |                                         |
         |                                         |
         v                                         v
   LinkedIn OAuth,                        AI/ML (Gemini, OpenAI),
   Content Calendar,                      Data Management,
   Analytics Dashboard                    LinkedIn API Integration
```

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) for a fast, responsive, and modern user interface.
- **Backend:** Built with FastAPI (Python) for high performance, async support, and automatic API documentation.
- **Database:** MongoDB (or in-memory for demo) for storing users, posts, and analytics.
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini and OpenAI APIs for content generation and optimization.

## AI Model Choices

- **Google Gemini:** Used for generating professional, context-aware LinkedIn posts and summaries. Chosen for its strong language understanding and ability to generate business-relevant content.
- **OpenAI (optional):** Used for post optimization and additional content suggestions.
- **Why Gemini/OpenAI?** Both provide state-of-the-art generative AI capabilities, easy API integration, and support for prompt engineering.

## Implementation Decisions

- **FastAPI for Backend:**  
  - Chosen for its speed, async support, and automatic OpenAPI docs.
  - Makes it easy to build, test, and document REST APIs.
- **Next.js for Frontend:**  
  - Enables server-side rendering, fast refresh, and a great developer experience.
  - Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent UI development.
- **LinkedIn OAuth:**  
  - Secure authentication and posting on behalf of users.
- **Content Calendar:**  
  - Visualizes scheduled posts and supports drag-and-drop (if implemented).
- **Analytics:**  
  - Tracks engagement, impressions, and other metrics for user feedback and strategy optimization.
- **Environment Variables:**  
  - Used for all secrets and configuration, following best practices for security and deployment.

## Summary

This architecture ensures:
- **Separation of concerns** for maintainability and scalability.
- **Modern developer experience** with TypeScript, React, and Python.
- **Easy extensibility** for new AI features, analytics, or integrations.
